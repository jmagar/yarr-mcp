# Active Context

## Current Task & State (as of last memory cycle)

The primary ongoing task was a systematic review and standardization of all MCP servers within the `src/` directory. The goal was to ensure alignment with the `create-mcp-server_v2.md` template and best practices. This involved:
*   Standardizing environment variable usage (for API credentials, MCP transport, host, port, logging).
*   Ensuring servers default to SSE transport.
*   Implementing robust logging (console and file).
*   Verifying correct `if __name__ == "__main__":` blocks and startup procedures, including critical env var checks.
*   Consolidating `.env` file loading to the project root (`../../.env`).
*   Removing redundant `requirements.txt` and `__init__.py` files from individual server directories.
*   Testing the tools for each server and creating/updating `<service>-mcp-tools-test-results.md` files.

The project was also renamed from `mcplex` to `yarr-mcp`.

The main project `README.md` was just updated to reflect the new project name, list all currently developed/reviewed servers, and provide revised setup, run, and client connection instructions (including SSE examples).

The current active step *is* this memory bank update.

## Recent Changes (Summary)

*   **Servers Processed**:
    *   `qbittorrent-mcp`: Reviewed, updated.
    *   `plex-mcp`: Reviewed, updated, `README.md` created.
    *   `overseerr-mcp`: Reviewed, updated.
    *   `tautulli-mcp`: Reviewed, updated.
    *   `sabnzbd-mcp`: Reviewed, updated.
    *   `prowlarr-mcp`: Reviewed, updated (was mostly compliant), tested.
    *   `portainer-mcp`: Reviewed, significant fixes to tool parameter handling, updated, tested.
    *   `unifi-mcp`: Reviewed, updated, tools tested.
    *   `unraid-mcp`: Reviewed, updated, tools tested (noted some API/server-side limitations).
*   **Key Technical Fixes**:
    *   Corrected `.env` loading paths in server scripts to point to the project root.
    *   Resolved `FastMCP` API usage issues (e.g., `mcp.run()` vs `mcp.run_server()`, parameter passing in `_portainer_request`).
    *   Addressed tool signature mismatches causing failures (e.g., Portainer tools).
*   **Project-Level Changes**:
    *   Renamed project to `yarr-mcp`.
    *   Updated main `README.md` extensively.
    *   Confirmed dependency management via root `pyproject.toml`.
*   **Documentation**:
    *   Created/Updated test result markdown files for reviewed servers.
    *   Individual server `README.md` files were updated during their review process.

## Next Steps

1.  **Complete this Memory Bank Update**: Ensure all five `cline_docs/` files are accurate and comprehensive.
2.  **Process `gotify-mcp`**: This server is listed in the main `README.md` but has not yet been explicitly reviewed, updated against the template, or tested as part of the recent sweep. This is the most likely next development task.
3.  **Verify Tool Testing for All Servers**: While many servers were tested, ensure comprehensive tool testing reports exist and are accurate for *all* servers (including those updated earlier in the process like qbittorrent, plex, etc.).
4.  **Review Individual READMEs for Root .env Path**: Confirm that individual server `README.md` files accurately reflect that the `.env` file is loaded from the project root, not their local directory.

# Active Context: Unifi Site Manager MCP Server Development

## What You're Working On Now
Completed the initial implementation and debugging phase for the Unifi Site Manager MCP server. The immediate last step was to synthesize the project's progress and details into the Memory Bank files, as requested by the user.

## Recent Changes (This Session)
- **Service Research & API Analysis**: 
    - Fetched FastMCP best practices documentation.
    - Researched the Unifi Site Manager API using web search and by directly fetching its documentation pages (overview, getting started, response format, version control, and all specific endpoint details).
- **Tool Design & Iteration**:
    - Proposed an initial set of tools based on the API capabilities.
    - Collaboratively refined the toolset with the user:
        - Confirmed SSE as the transport method.
        - Agreed to make list operations fetch all pages automatically.
        - Confirmed comfort with using Early Access (EA) API endpoints.
        - Removed the `get_device_details` tool due to implementation complexity (would have required client-side filtering of `list_devices` output).
- **Implementation**: 
    - Created the main server script `src/unifi-mcp/unifi_mcp_server.py` using FastMCP and `httpx`.
    - Implemented a helper function `_make_api_request` to handle API calls, authentication, error handling, rate limiting, and automatic pagination.
    - Implemented all approved tools: `list_hosts`, `get_host_by_id`, `list_sites`, `list_devices`, `get_isp_metrics`, `query_isp_metrics`, `list_sdwan_configs`, `get_sdwan_config_by_id`, `get_sdwan_config_status`.
    - Configured SSE transport for the server.
- **Project Files Created**:
    - `src/unifi-mcp/requirements.txt`
    - `src/unifi-mcp/.env.example`
    - `src/unifi-mcp/README.md` (including setup, usage, and client configuration examples).
- **Debugging**: 
    - Resolved `ImportError` for `ToolContext` by first trying `fastmcp.server.ToolContext` and then correctly removing the `ctx` parameter from tool definitions as it was unused and causing issues with current FastMCP patterns.

## Next Steps
- **Testing**: The server needs to be thoroughly tested against a live Unifi Site Manager API to ensure all tools function as expected, especially with pagination and EA endpoints.
- **User Feedback**: Await user feedback after they test the server.
- **Memory Bank Update**: This current action â€“ updating the memory bank files.
- **Further Development**: Based on testing and user feedback, potential future work could include refining error messages, adding more specific data transformations, or implementing new tools if the API expands or new use cases arise.
