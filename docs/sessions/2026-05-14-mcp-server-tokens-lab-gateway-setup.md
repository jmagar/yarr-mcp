## User Request

Test 6 custom MCP servers (unrust, rustscale, rustifi, rustify, apprise-mcp, rmcp-template) using mcporter with their external URLs, generate secure bearer tokens for all of them, and add them to the lab gateway at lab.tootie.tv with protected paths named after each repo.

## Session Overview

Audited 6 MCP servers running locally in Docker, discovered they had no auth tokens and were running with no-auth flags set, generated secure 256-bit bearer tokens for each, restarted/recreated the containers to pick up the new credentials, tested all 6 with mcporter via their real HTTPS proxy domains, and added all 6 to the lab gateway at `https://lab.tootie.tv/gateways` with bearer token auth and protected paths under `https://mcp.tootie.tv/`.

## Sequence of Events

1. Invoked `mcporter` skill and attempted to list tools via Tailscale IP — discovered `--allow-http` requirement and then OAuth flow triggering
2. Investigated `.env` files for all 6 repos — found no MCP bearer tokens, only `NOAUTH=true` / `DISABLE_HTTP_AUTH=true` flags
3. Generated 6 secure tokens via `openssl rand -hex 32`
4. Wrote tokens to each repo's `.env` file using the correct env var name per server, removing the no-auth flags
5. Attempted `docker restart` — discovered it does NOT re-read `.env` files; switched to `docker compose up -d --force-recreate`
6. Discovered `unrust` crashed on restart — its `.env` was created from scratch with blank `UNRAID_API_KEY`; found credentials in `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab/.env` and `/home/jmagar/workspace/unraid-mcp/.env`
7. Re-recreated unrust container with correct credentials; all 6 confirmed healthy via `/health` endpoints
8. Tested all 6 with `mcporter list <name>` using real HTTPS domains — all returned tool schemas successfully
9. Navigated to `https://lab.tootie.tv/gateways` via Claude-in-Chrome browser automation
10. Added all 6 servers to the lab gateway using JavaScript-driven form fill (React inputs required native setter + synthetic events), bearer token auth, and protected paths
11. Verified configured count incremented 12→13→14→15→16→17→18 as each server was added

## Key Findings

- All 6 servers had no bearer tokens and were running with auth disabled — `NOAUTH=true` env vars in their Docker containers
- The env var names for "no auth" differed from what the servers actually read: e.g., `TAILSCALE_MCP_DISABLE_HTTP_AUTH` vs the code-expected `TAILSCALE_MCP_NO_AUTH` (`rustscale/src/config.rs:191`)
- `docker restart` does NOT re-read `.env` files — `docker compose up -d --force-recreate` is required
- `unrust` had no `.env` file at all; credentials live in `/home/jmagar/workspace/lab/.env` and `/home/jmagar/workspace/unraid-mcp/.env`
- The SWAG reverse proxy (on `squirts`) serves all 6 under different subdomains — not the repo names as assumed
- The lab gateway UI requires HTTPS URLs and uses `https://mcp.tootie.tv/` as the base for protected paths
- React form inputs in the lab gateway require the native input value setter + synthetic events — standard `form_input`/`fill` tools don't work

## Technical Decisions

- Used `openssl rand -hex 32` for tokens (256-bit entropy, hex-encoded, industry standard for bearer tokens)
- Used `docker compose up -d --force-recreate` instead of `docker restart` to ensure new env vars are picked up
- Used JavaScript `Object.getOwnPropertyDescriptor(HTMLInputElement.prototype, 'value').set` to set React-controlled inputs, as standard DOM value assignment bypasses React's synthetic event system
- Used real HTTPS domain URLs in both mcporter config and lab gateway (not Tailscale IP or localhost) to match the actual proxy setup

| `/home/jmagar/workspace/rustscale/.env` | Replaced no-auth flags with `TAILSCALE_MCP_TOKEN=<token>` |
| `/home/jmagar/workspace/apprise-mcp/.env` | Replaced no-auth flags with `APPRISE_MCP_TOKEN=<token>` |

## Errors Encountered

| Error | Root Cause | Resolution |
|---|---|---|
| `mcporter: HTTP endpoints require --allow-http` | mcporter rejects plain http:// by default | Added `--allow-http` flag |
| `OAuthTimeoutError` on all servers | mcporter detected OAuth metadata endpoint returning `{"error":"not_found"}` and tried to complete OAuth flow | Used bearer token in `mcporter.json` instead of ad-hoc `--http-url` |
| `unraid-mcp` container crash-looping on restart | `.env` created from scratch had blank `UNRAID_API_KEY` | Located credentials in `lab/.env` and `unraid-mcp/.env` |
| Lab gateway: "gateway URL must use https:// scheme" | UI validates that upstream URLs use HTTPS | Switched from Tailscale IP to real HTTPS subdomain URLs |
| `reusedProtectedRoute is not defined` toast | Lab UI bug on server save — cosmetic only | Ignored; configured count still incremented confirming save succeeded |
| JSON editor in lab gateway swallowed input | Monaco editor ignores `type` action; `cmd+v` pastes to wrong target | Used JavaScript `setInput()` to set React form fields directly |
| Trailing comma in `mcporter.json` | Earlier edit deleted server entries as empty string, leaving `},` before `}` | Fixed with Edit tool |

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Server | Before | After |
|---|---|---|
| All 6 | No bearer token — auth disabled via env flags | Bearer token required; `NOAUTH` flags removed |
| All 6 | Not in mcporter config | Configured in `~/.mcporter/mcporter.json` with HTTPS URLs |
| All 6 | Not in lab gateway | Added to `https://lab.tootie.tv/gateways` with protected paths at `https://mcp.tootie.tv/<name>` |

## Risks and Rollback

- **Token exposure**: Bearer tokens are stored in plaintext in `.env` files and `mcporter.json`. The `.env` files should be gitignored (they are). The `mcporter.json` file at `~/.mcporter/` is outside the repo.
- **Lab gateway disconnected state**: All 6 new servers show as "Disconnected" in the lab UI because the gateway probes them through the protected path (via Authelia), not directly. This is expected and may require Authelia access rules to be configured.
- **Rollback**: To revert auth, add `<PREFIX>_MCP_NO_AUTH=true` back to each `.env` and recreate containers.

## Open Questions

- The lab gateway shows all 6 new servers as "Disconnected" (14 disconnected total vs 4 healthy). It's unclear whether the `https://mcp.tootie.tv/<path>` protected paths need Authelia rules configured before the gateway can probe them successfully.
- The `reusedProtectedRoute is not defined` toast appeared on every server save — unclear if this indicates a UI bug or a misconfiguration in the protected path setup.
- `gotify.subdomain.conf` has a different `$upstream_app` (100.75.111.118) vs `$mcp_upstream_app` (100.88.16.79) — the Gotify UI runs on a different host than the MCP server.

## Next Steps

**Unfinished from this session:**
- Verify the 6 new servers come online in the lab gateway (currently all show Disconnected)

**Follow-on tasks:**
- Configure Authelia access rules for `https://mcp.tootie.tv/unrust`, `/rustify`, `/rustifi`, `/rustscale`, `/apprise-mcp`, `/rmcp-template` if required for gateway probing
- Run `mcporter list` using the protected path URLs (via `https://mcp.tootie.tv/`) to confirm OAuth flow works end-to-end
- Commit the `.env` changes for each of the 6 repos (they are gitignored, so document token storage separately if needed)
- Consider storing tokens in a secret manager rather than plaintext `.env` files
