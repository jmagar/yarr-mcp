## User Request

Research how to create a Claude Code plugin theme, create an Aurora theme from the aurora-design-system colors, address all PR review comments on PR #1, and maintain a local infrastructure map in `CLAUDE.md.local`.

## Session Overview

Four main workstreams: (1) researched Claude Code custom theme format and created `~/.claude/themes/aurora.json` + `aurora-light.json` using the full official token set; (2) ran quick-push to open PR #1 on `refactor/server-api-module-split`; (3) fetched, fixed, and resolved all 16 PR review threads (3 P1s + 13 P2s) across two commits; (4) created and iteratively refined `CLAUDE.md.local` with the verified live infrastructure map including device IPs, service ports, repo paths, and SWAG proxy config filenames. Merged PR #1 to main and cleaned up the branch.

## Sequence of Events

1. Used `axon ask` → insufficient indexed content; fell back to Axon web research + scraping wmedia.es and official Claude Code docs
2. Explored `../aurora-design-system` via subagent to extract all CSS color tokens
3. Discovered existing `~/.claude/themes/aurora.json` used invalid/guessed token names — overwrote with correct official token set
4. Created `~/.claude/themes/aurora-light.json` (new)
5. Ran `/vibin:quick-push` — bumped `0.2.0 → 0.3.0`, committed 39 files, pushed branch, opened PR #1
6. Fetched PR #1 comments via `gh-address-comments` skill — 16 open threads (3 P1, 13 P2), beads auto-created
7. Read all affected files, applied all 16 fixes in one commit (`3b2c120`)
8. Pushed, posted "Fixed in HEAD" replies to all 16 threads, marked all resolved
9. Verified resolution via fresh fetch — `✓ All 16 threads resolved`
10. Checked for new comments — only "Thanks for fixing this!" from cubic-dev-ai, no new issues
11. Created `CLAUDE.md.local` with device/service/port map from previous session notes
12. Dropped redundant "Related repos" section; added Repo column to service map instead
13. SSHed into squirts to get actual SWAG proxy config filenames and verified all upstream/mcp_upstream ports against live configs — found 3 discrepancies, corrected them
14. Merged PR #1 via `gh pr merge 1 --merge`, pulled main, deleted local+remote branch, pruned refs

## Key Findings

- Claude Code theme tokens: 40+ named tokens across text/accent, status, mode indicators, diff backgrounds, fullscreen fills, subagent colors, shimmer pairs, rainbow gradient — the old `aurora.json` used entirely invalid names that were silently ignored
- Live SWAG port discrepancies vs session notes: gotify upstream was `squirts:8070` (not dookie), lab was `dookie:8765` (not "lab container"), syslog was `dookie:3100` (not "syslog container")
- `rustify` = gotify MCP server (not a mystery repo) — follows the `rust*` naming convention for all 9 family members
- `dependabot/fetch-metadata@v2` commit SHA: `21025c705c08248db411dc16f3619e6b5f9ea21a`
- `apps/web/out/` is gitignored — `COPY apps/web/out/` in Dockerfile always failed on fresh clone; fixed with `.gitkeep` + `.gitignore` exception

## Technical Decisions

- **`claude` token → violet `#a78bfa`**: Aurora reserves violet for AI/automation contexts (`--aurora-accent-violet`); cyan is for interactive elements. Semantically correct mapping.
- **`.env` permissions**: Used write-then-`set_permissions` (TOCTOU window acceptable) over `OpenOptions::mode` — simpler, no new module-level imports needed, `#[cfg(unix)]` scoped
- **entrypoint.sh passthrough**: Added `case` statement checking known subcommands; anything else (e.g. `bash`) `exec`s directly under gosu without prepending the binary
- **`rs_production_lines` fix**: Switched from `grep '#[cfg(test)]' | head -1` to an awk pattern matching `#[cfg(test)]` immediately preceding a `mod` declaration — avoids cutting on `#[cfg(test)]` attributes on individual functions
- **Dropped "Related repos" section** from `CLAUDE.md.local`: it duplicated the service map which already has a Repo column

## Errors Encountered

- **`verify_resolution` showed 16 unresolved** after `mark_resolved --all`: script was reading stale `/tmp/pr1.json`. Fixed by re-fetching with `--no-beads` before verifying.
- **Cargo.toml Edit conflict**: file modified externally between read and write during quick-push; re-read and retried.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Aurora theme in `/theme` | Present but ~35 tokens silently ignored (invalid names) | All 40+ tokens applied correctly |
| `aurora-light` theme | Did not exist | Available in `/theme` picker |
| `EXAMPLE_MCP_AUTH_MODE=typo` | Silently used Bearer | Hard error at startup |
| `docker run ... bash` | Ran `example bash` (unknown subcommand error) | Execs `bash` directly under gosu |
| `.env` secrets file | World-readable (default umask) | `chmod 0600` on Unix |
| `lefthook.yml` file-size hook | Only matched root-level `*.rs` files | Matches `**/*.rs` in all subdirectories |
| `localhost:3000` in Justfile | Wrong port (mismatch with default 40060) | Corrected to `localhost:3100` |
| `apps/web/out/` COPY in Dockerfile | Failed on fresh clone (dir gitignored) | `.gitkeep` ensures COPY always succeeds |
| PR #1 review threads | 16 open | 16 resolved |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| `cargo check` | Finished dev | Finished dev | ✓ |
| `verify_resolution.py` (fresh fetch) | 16 resolved | 16 resolved | ✓ |
| `gh pr merge 1 --merge` | merged | `ok merged #1` | ✓ |
| `git pull` on main | up to date | 96 files changed | ✓ |
| `git branch` after cleanup | only `main` | `* main` | ✓ |

## Next Steps

**Follow-on (not started):**
- Ship Aurora themes inside `.claude-plugin/themes/` so they distribute with `plugin install`
- Deploy syslog-mcp and axon_rust with updated Aurora logging (rebuild containers on dookie)
- Verify `ts.tootie.tv` and `rmcp.tootie.tv` resolve correctly (DNS/cert)
- Consider extracting `AuroraLevelFormatter` into a shared crate across all 9 repos
- Index Claude Code theme token docs into Axon for future `axon ask` queries
