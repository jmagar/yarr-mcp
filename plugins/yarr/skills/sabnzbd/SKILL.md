description: This skill should be used when the user wants to manage Usenet downloads with SABnzbd. Triggers include: "what's downloading", "SABnzbd status", "NZB queue", "add NZB", "pause downloads", "resume downloads", "slow down downloads", "retry failed downloads", "SAB history", "download queue", "is SABnzbd running", or any mention of Usenet download management.

# SABnzbd API

Manage Usenet downloads via SABnzbd's REST API.

## Purpose

This skill provides **read and write** access to your SABnzbd Usenet downloader:
- Monitor download queue and history
- Add NZB files by URL or upload
- Control downloads (pause, resume, delete)
- Adjust download speed limits
- Manage categories and post-processing scripts
- Retry failed downloads
- View server statistics and warnings

Operations include both read and write actions. **Always confirm before deleting downloads with file deletion.**

## Setup

Credentials are configured in the **plugin settings** (userConfig). A `SessionStart` hook writes them to `~/.config/lab-sabnzbd/config.env`, which the scripts load automatically — no manual file editing. Variables used:

```bash
SABNZBD_URL="http://localhost:8080"
SABNZBD_API_KEY="your-api-key-from-config-general"
```

Get your API key from SABnzbd Config → General → Security.


## Quick Reference

### Queue Status

```bash
# Full queue
./scripts/sab-api.sh queue

# With filters
./scripts/sab-api.sh queue --limit 10 --category tv

# Specific job
./scripts/sab-api.sh queue --nzo-id SABnzbd_nzo_xxxxx
```

### Add NZB

```bash
# By URL (indexer link)
./scripts/sab-api.sh add "https://indexer.com/get.php?guid=..."

# With options
./scripts/sab-api.sh add "URL" --name "My Download" --category movies --priority high

# By local file
./scripts/sab-api.sh add-file /path/to/file.nzb --category tv
```

Priority: `force`, `high`, `normal`, `low`, `paused`, `duplicate`

### Control Queue

```bash
./scripts/sab-api.sh pause              # Pause all
./scripts/sab-api.sh resume             # Resume all
./scripts/sab-api.sh pause-job <nzo_id>
./scripts/sab-api.sh resume-job <nzo_id>
./scripts/sab-api.sh delete <nzo_id>    # Keep files
./scripts/sab-api.sh delete <nzo_id> --files  # Delete files too
./scripts/sab-api.sh purge              # Clear queue
```

### Speed Control

```bash
./scripts/sab-api.sh speedlimit 5120    # 5 MB/s, in KB/s
./scripts/sab-api.sh speedlimit 5M      # Helper also accepts M/K suffixes
./scripts/sab-api.sh speedlimit 0       # Unlimited
```

### History

```bash
./scripts/sab-api.sh history
./scripts/sab-api.sh history --limit 20 --failed
./scripts/sab-api.sh retry <nzo_id>     # Retry failed
./scripts/sab-api.sh retry-all          # Retry all failed
./scripts/sab-api.sh delete-history <nzo_id>
```

### Categories & Scripts

```bash
./scripts/sab-api.sh categories
./scripts/sab-api.sh scripts
./scripts/sab-api.sh change-category <nzo_id> movies
./scripts/sab-api.sh change-script <nzo_id> notify.py
./scripts/sab-api.sh change-priority <nzo_id> high
./scripts/sab-api.sh rename <nzo_id> "New Name" [password]
./scripts/sab-api.sh warnings-clear
```

> SABnzbd's API takes the key as a query parameter (`?apikey=…`). That is inherent
> to its API; keep the server on loopback or behind a trusted proxy so the key
> isn't logged by intermediaries.

### Status & Info

```bash
./scripts/sab-api.sh status             # Full status
./scripts/sab-api.sh version
./scripts/sab-api.sh warnings
./scripts/sab-api.sh server-stats       # Download stats
```

## Response Format

Queue slot includes:
- `nzo_id`, `filename`, `status`
- `mb`, `mbleft`, `percentage`
- `timeleft`, `priority`, `cat`
- `script`, `labels`

Status values: `Downloading`, `Queued`, `Paused`, `Propagating`, `Fetching`

History status: `Completed`, `Failed`, `Queued`, `Verifying`, `Repairing`, `Extracting`

## Workflow

When the user asks about Usenet downloads:

1. **"What's downloading?"** → Run `queue` to show active downloads
2. **"Add this NZB"** → Run `add "<url>"` with appropriate category and priority
3. **"Pause all downloads"** → Run `pause`
4. **"Resume downloads"** → Run `resume`
5. **"Show download history"** → Run `history`
6. **"Retry failed downloads"** → Run `retry-all` or `retry <nzo_id>`
7. **"Slow down downloads"** → Run `speedlimit <KB/s>` or use the helper's `M`/`K` suffix

## Notes

- Requires network access to your SABnzbd server
- Uses SABnzbd API (v2+)
- All data operations return JSON
- **Delete operations with --files are permanent** - always confirm before deleting downloaded files
- Speed limits are sent to SABnzbd in KB/s; the helper converts values like `5M` to KB/s
- NZB files can be added by URL (indexer links) or local file upload
- Post-processing scripts are executed after download completion
