//! The parsed-CLI `Command` enum — pure data, no logic.
//!
//! This is the output of [`crate::cli::parse_args`] and the input to
//! [`crate::cli::run`]. Variants fall into two groups:
//!
//!   - **Service-grouped** (`Status`/`Get`/`Post`/`Put`/`Delete`) — produced by
//!     the per-capability parse hook in [`crate::cli::router`]. These cover the
//!     generic passthrough verbs; curated `<service> <verb>` commands are parsed
//!     by the live `src/cli/commands/<cap>.rs` modules and dispatched through the
//!     same shared service layer.
//!   - **Infra, service-less** (`Help`/`Doctor`/`Watch`/`Setup`)
//!     — produced directly by the router's infra branch.
//!
//! `Doctor`, `Watch`, and `Setup` are dispatched specially in
//! `main.rs::run_cli` because they need the full `Config` (MCP fields), not just
//! `RustarrConfig`. `serve`/`mcp` never reach this enum — `main.rs` intercepts
//! them as run modes before `parse_args` is called.

use super::setup::SetupCommand;

// `Eq` is intentionally not derived: the `Curated` variant carries a
// `serde_json::Value` (which is `PartialEq` but not `Eq`). `PartialEq` is all the
// tests need (`assert_eq!`).
