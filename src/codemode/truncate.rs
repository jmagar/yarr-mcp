//! Code-Mode-aware response budgeting.
//!
//! The Code Mode envelope (`{result, calls, logs, artifacts, …}`) can blow an
//! agent's context window. rustarr's transport layer already caps the whole MCP
//! tool response at [`crate::token_limit::MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES`] — but that cap is a
//! *blind byte slice* that chops `result` mid-JSON and discards the audit envelope
//! structure. This pass shapes the envelope INTELLIGENTLY, strictly BELOW the
//! transport cap, so the agent always receives parseable JSON:
//!
//! Sacrifice order is value-ordered — preserve `result` (the answer), then the
//! `calls` audit, then `logs` (debug output):
//!
//! 1. If the serialized envelope already fits the budget → leave it untouched.
//! 2. Otherwise set `logs` aside entirely (measure `result`/`calls`/`artifacts` on
//!    their own) — the script's answer is more valuable than its debug output.
//!    (yarr diverges from lab here, which caps the result first.)
//! 3. If that non-log payload is itself still over budget, replace an oversized
//!    `result` with a structured, parseable
//!    `{truncated, original_bytes, original_tokens, preview, next_action}` marker
//!    — a result-specific marker in the same *spirit* as `token_limit`'s
//!    `{truncated, reason, partial}` (both lead with `truncated: true` so an agent
//!    can branch programmatically), but a distinct shape — then, if STILL over,
//!    trim the `calls` audit newest-first with a `{truncated_calls: N}` sentinel.
//! 4. Finally, fit back as many of the newest `logs` lines as the remaining budget
//!    allows (prepending a `[logs truncated …]` sentinel when some are dropped).
//!
//! The budget is *derived from* `MAX_RESPONSE_BYTES` (3/5 of it ≈ 24 KB, the same
//! figure lab and Cloudflare's codemode use) so the two caps can never invert and
//! the shaped envelope never trips the transport truncation that would undo this
//! work. Token counts in the marker are informational (bytes / 4, a conservative
//! over-estimate for JSON); the budget *check* is bytes, matching the transport cap.
