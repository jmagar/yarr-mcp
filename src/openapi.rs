//! Generated OpenAPI operation surface (runtime side).
//!
//! For the 6 spec-backed services (Sonarr, Radarr, Prowlarr, Overseerr, Jellyfin,
//! Plex) the entire upstream API — every operation and every component type — is
//! **generated from the vendored OpenAPI specs** under `specs/` by
//! `cargo xtask gen-openapi`, not hand-written. This module holds the runtime
//! shapes the generated tables fill in ([`OperationSpec`], [`TypeDef`]), the
//! per-kind registry, and the generic executor that turns one
//! `(service, op, args)` call into an upstream request.
//!
//! Discovery (`codemode.search`/`describe`) and the per-service callable namespace
//! are driven entirely off these tables, so adding/refreshing a service is a
//! regeneration step — there is no hand-rolled curated command or model for these
//! kinds.
