-   **Patterns in errors**:
    *   There's a consistent pattern of errors when optional integer parameters (`time_range`, `user_id`) are provided. The error message `Parameter '...' must be one of types [integer, null], got number` indicates a type mismatch. This suggests that the server-side Pydantic models are strictly expecting `int` for these fields (as confirmed by the Tautulli API documentation), but the values might be passed in a way that Pydantic interprets as a more general `number` (e.g. float) if they are not explicitly cast or handled as strict integers by the calling environment or the server's FastAPI/Pydantic type coercion logic isn't handling it as expected.
-   **Recommendations for improvements**:
    *   **Primary Recommendation**: Investigate and fix the type handling for optional integer parameters in the Tautulli MCP server. Ensure that if the schema defines an `int` (which the Tautulli API docs confirm for `time_range` and `user_id`), the Pydantic models on the server correctly validate or coerce numerical inputs to `int` where appropriate, or that the tool calling mechanism sends these values as strict integers. The server should ideally be robust enough to accept a number like `30` as an integer for a field typed as `Optional[int]`.
